Material Design Music Player with mp3 cutter, sleep timer and lots of amazing features.

<h1>Musific Music Player</h1>
Musific is a free, Material design and open source music player for Android. . Due to my lack of adequate free time, I've decided that I can no longer provide the level of support and regular updates that users expect from a developer.

This app is based on open source project and I've learn many things from these projects so now I've open sourced the app and hosted it here to encourage other developers to potentially improve it, use it in their own personal projects, and re-release it to users. I will still occasionally update this app based on my free time.

If you are a developer who's interested in using Musific current codebase, I encourage you to fork this repository and/or directly contribute to it. If you decide to launch your own fork of Musific on the Play Store, feel free to drop me a line so I can feature it on this GitHub page.
